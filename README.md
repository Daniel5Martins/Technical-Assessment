# Technical Assessment on Bioinformatics & Machine Learning

Public repository for consideration by the Firalis S.A. & Amoneta Diagnostics Portuguese branch recruitment team.

**Part 1** is a Bioinformatics Mini-Pipeline for processing and aligning sequencing reads, including indications of subsequent steps leading to variant calling.

**Part 2** is a Machine Learning Mini-Project that builds a simple classification model to predict diagnostic status using a pre-processed Alzheimer's disease dataset.

Note: Input data and intermediary files (e.g BAM files) are not included in this public repository.
